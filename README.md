# Class of Game Development in Tbilisi State University
Games that we learned during class are written in Lua and are using Game Engine (`LOVE2D`)[https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page]. More about that in documentation.
Love2D checks for `main.lua` file which should contain initial logic. To run any game, just run 
```shell
love .
```
within the directory with `main.lua`. Or do
```shell
love with/path/to/the/main.lua
```
